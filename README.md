# Zura – Presence, Redefined

**Zura** is a speculative design project that imagines a new kind of long-distance connection — one that goes beyond screens. Built as a website prototype, Zura explores how touch, warmth, and presence might be shared across distance using soft robotics and emotional technology.

This project asks:  
> *What if a hug could travel across continents?*

## 🧩 What the Website Shows

The site walks you through a near-future product called Zura — a soft, morphable companion that transforms into a gentle version of someone you love. It’s made to sit with you, breathe beside you, and offer quiet comfort when a video call just isn’t enough.

It includes:

- A bold landing page with the tagline **“Presence, Redefined”**
- The emotional problem behind Zura, backed by real-world stats  
- A breakdown of the imagined features: biometric scans, haptic feedback, nano-movement, and heartbeat syncing  
- A simple 3-step process: **Capture → Send → Embrace**
- A soft, moody tone throughout that reflects the emotional heart of the idea

## 💡 Why We Built This

Zura was created as part of NYUAD's IM-UH 1012 Communication & Technology final project. It’s speculative — meaning it doesn’t exist (yet) — but it’s grounded in real trends:  
- Families living apart  
- The limits of digital communication  
- Emerging soft robotics and biometric tech  
- A growing desire for *emotional presence*, not just connectivity

Zura is a response to that ache — the kind that voice notes can’t solve. It’s not about replacing people. It’s about helping them show up, even when they can’t.

## 📝 A Note

Zura is not a real product. It’s a design fiction — a “what if” built to feel possible. The goal wasn’t to sell something, but to tell a story about what presence could mean in a time of constant connection and constant distance.
